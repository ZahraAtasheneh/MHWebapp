## Mental Health Web App

This web application is designed to assist in processing and labelling training and evaluation data for an AI-based mental health chatbot. The web app allows a non-technical subject matter expert to review transcriptions from therapy sessions and assign relevant codes that describe the nature of the conversation. It provides a user-friendly interface to annotate messages and visualize the assigned codes.

## Features

- Retrieving example messages and codes via APIs.
- Creating, updating, and deleting codes and their associations with messages.
- Viewing and annotating messages with assigned codes.
- Generating chatbot responses based on user messages.
- Persistence of coding data beyond the runtime of the web server.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Python 3.10, FastAPI
- Frontend: JavaScript (Vue.js)
- Testing: pytest
- Database: In-memory database (Python list)
- HTTP Server: Uvicorn

## Setup and Running the Web App

1. Clone the repository:


git clone <repository-url>
Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
  
  
cd <repository-folder>
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the web server:
  
  
uvicorn main:app --host=localhost --port=8000 --reload
Access the web app in your browser at http://localhost:8000.

Additional Features for Responsible AI:
To build a demonstrable and responsible AI, the following additional features can be incorporated into the data curation tool:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication to ensure secure access to the web app and protect sensitive data.

Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations by implementing data anonymization and encryption measures.

Audit Trail: Maintain an audit trail of coding changes, including timestamps and user information, for accountability and traceability.

Explainability: Provide explanations or justifications for the assigned codes to enhance the transparency and interpretability of the AI system.

Bias Detection and Mitigation: Integrate mechanisms to detect and mitigate biases in the training and evaluation data to ensure fair and unbiased AI predictions.

Training and Evaluating a Classifier
To train and evaluate a classifier for automatically coding messages, the following steps can be followed:

Data Collection: Gather a production-level dataset of annotated messages with assigned codes.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the messages by removing noise, standardizing formats, and transforming text into numerical representations (e.g., word embeddings).

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed data, such as sentiment scores, keyword frequencies, or linguistic patterns.

Classifier Training: Train a classification model using supervised learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or deep learning models) on the annotated message dataset. Split the dataset into training and validation sets for model evaluation.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained classifier using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, on the validation dataset. Fine-tune the model and iterate if necessary.

Deployment and Monitoring: Deploy the trained classifier as part of the mental health chatbot system. Continuously monitor and evaluate the classifier's performance in real-world scenarios to identify and address any issues or biases.

Iterative Improvement: Gather user feedback and use it to iteratively improve the classifier's performance and the overall chatbot system.

Risks and Mitigation
Some potential risks associated with the web app and its usage include:

Data Security: To mitigate data security risks, ensure that the web app is hosted on a secure server, use encryption for sensitive data, and implement user authentication and authorization.

Biases in Annotation: Biases may arise during the annotation process. Provide clear guidelines and instructions to annotators and periodically review and calibrate the annotations to minimize bias.

Limited Generalization: The trained classifier's performance may not generalize well to unseen data. Regularly update the training dataset and retrain the classifier to improve its generalization capabilities.

Ethical Considerations: Consider the ethical implications and potential harms of the chatbot system. Ensure that the collected data is anonymized and used responsibly, and prioritize user privacy and well-being.
